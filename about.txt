Track-IVC

Track-IVC is a web project created by Team OGG using Docker engine. The team is currently consists of
three aspiring programmers: Alvin Ng, Mark Kyaw, and Chee Ho Tey.

The goal of this project is to create a website that shows organizations their current existing
balance according to the Student Life Office's records on demand. With this website, the goal is
people will be able to plan their budget accordingly and eliminate any communication error
that may happen between students and the Student Life Office relating to their budget.

Alvin Ng was the one who initially came up with the idea after noticing the issue in the time
he has served in ASG of IVC. This idea was cultivated further throughout the Spring Semester
of 2017 and the production process officially began in Summer of 2017. After hours of work
committed in the Summer, the project is ready to be published into production purpose.
The team is currently researching on how to host the project onto AWS.

As of right now, the website can only show how much balance do people have in their account.
There will be future updates later in the year of 2017-2018 with updated UI and more
functionalities.
